# BridgeLabz-Training

## 📌 Description
This repository is part of the training program provided by **BridgeLabz** in collaboration with  **Capgemini**.  
During this training, I am working on multiple technologies to strengthen my fundamentals, understand real-world development workflows, and improve problem-solving skills through hands-on practice.

---
**Outcomes**

- R&d on Modifiers ,  Learned C# Elements
- Demonstartion of AccessModifiers code pushed 

### Day6 (21 Dec 2025)
- sunday ,  so that  no work has been done

### Day7 (22 Dec 2025)
**Control Flows**

Flow of Programming:
- Understanding how a program moves from Input → Process → Output.

Program Constructs:
- Sequence: Code executes line by line.
- Selection: if-else and switch-case statements for decision-making.
- Iteration: for loop, while loop, and do-while loop for repetition.

Control Flow Practice:
- Practiced if-else, switch-case, while loop, for loop, and do-while loop.
- Learned where each loop is used.

Loop Usage Guide:
- Use for loop when number of iterations is known.
- Use while loop when number of iterations is unknown.
- Use do-while loop when the loop must run at least once.

Creating Projects in Visual Studio:
- Learned how to create new projects.
- Explored Solution Explorer.
- Understood how to run and debug C# programs.

Top-Level Code:
- Top-level statements allow writing code without a class and Main method.
- Compiler generates an internal class automatically, so it becomes internal by default.
- Important: Do not click "Do not use top-level statements" because it changes program structure.

Git Branch and Code Cleanliness:
- Keep your branch clean by creating your project in a separate folder first.
- Then move this folder into the local GitHub-connected directory.
- Helps maintain clean repo structure and better workflow.


<!-- - Flow of Programming 
- program Construct (Sequence , Selection , Iteration)
- if-else ,  Switch case , While loop , For loop 
- practiced on control flows 
- learned where to use for loop , while loop and do while loop
- also learned how create a project in visual studio
- what is top level code and why it is by default internal
- do not click on do not make top level code 
- how to keep your branch and code clean and make a seperate folder to this project then paste to the local folder where the system connected to git hub repo -->

## 📎 Notes
This repository is maintained for **learning and training purposes**.  
More sessions, assignments, and improvements will be added as the training progresses.
